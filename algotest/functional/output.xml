Currently it is best platform for algo traders.
Charges are very low as compared to other platforms. Main thing is execution is good. Have been using since 1 year. Only minus point is currently they don't support commodity. Hope so that will come soon.

I've been collaborating with Raghav Malik for a while now, and I genuinely believe that for any serious trader or investor, automation has become essential.
The days of manually punching in orders are long behind us. As a systematic/quant-based research analyst,
I find AlgoTest to be one of the
most robust and versatile platforms available in the market.

One of the big differentiator between HFT and non-HFT first is the tools and technology used by HFT.
